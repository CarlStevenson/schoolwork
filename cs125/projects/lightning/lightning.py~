#          seconds between the flash and the bang.

    print("between the flash and the sound of thunder.")
    print("You will be asked to enter the time in seconds")
    print("between flash and bang.")
    print("Written by Carl Stevenson")
    print()

#ask for time in seconds

    time = eval(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))
    print("\n")

#calculate distance

    speed = 1100
    mile = 5280
    dist = ((speed * time) / mile)

#output the time

    print("Time between flash and bang :", time, "seconds")
    
#output distance
