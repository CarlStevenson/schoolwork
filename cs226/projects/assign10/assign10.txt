Description:

  assign10.cpp provides a menu interface for the user to interact with a graph that is defined at the start of the program. The menu allows for the user to do a depth and breadth first search on the graph, as well as a topological sort.
  
Valid input:

  Number of vertices n: integer value 0 < n
  Edge specification: integer corresponding to a valid vertex
  Menu item: integer value 1<= n <= 4
