Compiler is a translator

source language --> target language

subset of Pascal --> x86 assembly


compiler phases:
    front end - lexical analysis(scanning)
                syntax analysis(parsing)
                semantic analysis(type checking, etc)
                intermediate code generation
                optimization (machine independent)
                code generation
                optimization (machine dependent)
                
                
                
                
                
lexical analysis:

    split source program into a sequence of lexemes(small units of text that go together)
    
    	ex:  !=
    		 for
    		 ;
    
    lexemes are represented by data structures called tokens
    
    types of lexemes: punctuation
    				  reserved word (for)
    				  (^usually represented as an integer code)
    				  identifier	need code + symbol table entry
    				  constants		need code + value
    				  
    				  
    ex token:
    
    	struct token{
    		int type;
    		union{
    			char * lexeme;
    			int int_value;
    			double double_value;
    		} value;
    	}
    	
    	struct token t;
    	t.type = T_IDENTIFIER
    	t.value.lexeme = ...
    	
    	struct sotres values sequentially
    	union stores values in the same place
    	
    	
    scanner - (1) indentifies lexemes - returns tokens
    		  (2) removes white space
    		  (3) remove comments
    
    uses regular expressions
    	integer constants - [0-9]+ 
    	
    	
    scanner generator
    	specification of lexemes (regular expressions) --> function that scans
    	
    	
    Specifying lexemes with regular expressions
    
    once you identify lexemes, you have to put them together
    
    Falls under SYNTAX
    
    Specifying syntax:
        
        grammar
        BNF
        EBNF (extended BNF)
        
        ex simple grammar for expressions:
            
                Expr --> NUM			   | Both
Nonterminals |  Expr --> Expr oper Expr    | Productions
             |  op --> Plus          | terminals     
             |  op --> Minus		 |
             |  op --> Times		 |
             |  op --> Div			 |
            
            ^Not very good but complete for simple arithmetic operations
            
            syntax confers no meaning to the symbols
            
            only gives relationships between the symbols in a syntactically
            correct program
            
            Syntax - what is an allowable (syntactically correct) program?
            Semantics - what is the meaning of a program(what happens when it runs?)
            
            syntax is pretty basic
            
            
            You have a start symbol (we have 'E' for Expression)
            
            is 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 syntactically correct?
            
            Derivation:
            
            E --> E O E --> E O E O E --> E O E O E O E --> E P E O E O E
            
            	--> E P E M E O E --> E P E M E T E --> N P E M E T E
            	--> N P N M E T E --> N P N M N T E --> N P N M N T N
            
            replace non terminal by right hand side production(?)
            
            build a parse tree(syntax tree)
            where the items of the derivation matches the derivation
            
            			E
            		 /  |  \
            		E	O	E
            	 /  | \   /	|  \
            	E	O  E E	O	E
            	|	   | |		|
            	N	   N N		N
            	
            If there's more than one parse tree for some derivable tree, then
            the language is ambiguous
            
            standard ways of defining grammars that avoid ambiguity
            
            Expr --> Term
            Expr --> Expr + Term
            Expr --> Expr - Term
            Term --> Factor
            Term --> Term * Factor
            Term --> Term / Factor
            Factor --> Num
            Factor --> (Expr)
            
            Grammar built in levels where the precedence of the operators gets
            higher as you go down
            
            
            	
            	E
            	|
            E   -   T
          /  	     \
         E + T        T * F
    	 |   |		  |   |
    	 T	 F		  F   4
    	 |   |		  |
    	 F   2		  3
    	 |
    	 1	  
    	 
    	 
    	 Build parse trees so highest precedence is at the bottom,
    	 lowest precedence at the top
    	 
    	 Ex: C is much more complex, but in this scope, this is what is used
    	 
    	 sequence of terms, seperated by plus' and minus'
    	 parser based on recursion
    	 parser:
    	 	can produce the translation on the fly
    	 	
    	 	
    	 -->
    	 ::=
    	 
    	 E --> E + T | E - T
    	 			 ^or 
    	 E --> 
    	 	  ^Empty string
    	 	  
    	 EBNF syntax adds *(0 or more)
    	 				  ()
    	 
    	 can get
    	 E --> T((+1-)Term)*
    	 T --> F((*1/)F)*
    	 parser based on
    	 
    Next time: going to write a parser by hand
    	you write a function called parseexpression
    		E looks to see if the next token is valid for any of the valid right sides
    			if the next token is not valid, syntax error
    			otherwise, recursively called functions for the right hand sides
    		(problem with that
    		in order to work write, expression can't call expression right away
    		he'll show how to fix it)
    		
    		
    E --> T | E + T | E - T
    T -->F | T * F | T / F
    F --> N | (E)
    
    parse expression
    going to look at the non-terminals
    going to try to match up against them
    
    predicting grammar: the alternative for a production have non-terminating sets of allowable terminals
    can't predict which branch is needed
    
    need to re-write gramar so those sets are different
    
    Factor the grammar
    
    E --> T RT
    RT --> '+' T RT | '-' T RT | e
    
    parse_expr(){
    
    	parse_term();
    	parse_rest_of_term();
    }
    parse_rest_of_term(){
    
    	switch (lookatit){
    	
    		case '+': parse_term();
    				  parse_rest_of_term();
    				  break;
    		case '-': parse_term();
    				  parse_rest_of_term();
    				  break;
    		default:  return;
    	}
    }
    
    EBNF:
    
    E --> T('+' | '-' T)*
    
    parse_expr(){
    
    	parse_term();
    	
    	while(lookatit == '+' | lookatit == '-')
    		parse_term();
    }  	 
    
    syntax -directed translation
    
    annotate a grammer with instructions that show you have to do the translation
    
    E --> E + T
    E --> E-T
    E --> T
    T --> 0
    T --> 1
       |
       |
    T --> 9
    
    double bars mean to concatenate

    E.t := E1.t || T.t|| '-'	| semantic rule
    	 
    				  
    				  
    				  
    going to write the grammar
    going to write the semantic rules as well

    we're going to trnslate it into machine language for a (virtual)stat machine
    
    ADD --> pop 2 values off the stack and push the sum
    SUB --> pop 2 values, 1st is left, 2nd is right
    MUL --> similar to ADD
    DIV --> similar to SUB
    
    push --> constant
    print --> pops stack, prints value
    
    lvalue --> variable		(pushes lvalue onto the stack)
    rvalue --> variable		(pushes rvalue onto the stack)
    assign --> 		pops rvalue & lvalue and placed the lvalue in the variable who is the rvalue
    
    ex: go back to b := a + 2
    
    for 'a' we want the rvalue (value of the variable)
    for 'b' we want the lvalue (location of the varibale for assignment)
    
    lvalue is the standard for the location of a variable
    
    
    ex:
    	push 1
    	push 2
    	push 3
    	MUL
    	ADD
    	lvalue a
    	assign
    	rvalue a
    	print
    	push 3
    	push 4
    	ADD
    	print
    	rvalue a
    	push 2
    	ADD
    	lvalue b

compiler: generates code in a target language
interpreter: executes code directly
    
  3+4*5
  how to compute the values of expressions
  
  how to you evaluate that expression on the fly?
  have a tree structure
  write an eval function
    takes expression e
    
    eval(e){
      switch(e->op){
      
        case PLUS:
          return eval(e->left) + eval(e->right);
        case TIMES:
          return eval(e->left * eval(e->right); 
      }
    }
    
    constant folding
      compiler replaces a constant expression with it's value
      
    
    
    
    
    
    
    x+y*5
    
    how does an interpreter evaluate an expression like that?
    needs the values of x and y
    
    compiler has address for the variable
    interpreter needs to lookup value
    
    
    environment
      table that associates values with names
    
    
    assume have an environment env
      lookup(env, v)  returns value of v
        pass expression to eval, have to also pass the environment
        
        eval(e, env){
          switch(e->type){
            case INT_CONST: return e->value;
            case VARIABLE: return lookup(env, v);
          }
        }
        
        
        
        write eval type function that evaluates the type of the expression
        
        use it to determine the type of the result
        allows it to throw type errors
        
        however, there are a lot of combinations
        
        writing a type checker is trivial and tedious
        
        optimization can be built in
        
        one the parser can do:
        
          expr -> T_PLUS expr
        
        
        not is a prefix operator
        has highest of all precedences usually
        
        x and y not is postfix and has lowest precedence

pascal has funtions and procedures

  function f(x,y : integer): integer;
  begin
  .
  .
  .
  .
  end
  
  procedures return nothing
              passing address of x by putting var in the declaration
  procedure p(var x :integer, y: real);
  begin
  .
  end
  
  
  in order to pass a value, it has to be assignment compatable with the declaration
    
    passing by reference, 
    
    
    
    
    
  in java

    f(int &x, int y)
              ^passed by value
      ^ wut
      
    have variables int &x
    
    &var is an implicit pointer
    
    reference is like a pointer
    don't have to use the address and pointer operator[needs citation]
    
    in c++, pass a reference by value
    
    tl;dr don't need pass by reference function
    
  in C:
  
    f(char *s)   <- pointer to array is passed by value

adding

  booleans


  enter type checking

  assembly has an 'and' instruction, andq
  or, orq
  not, notq
    can we implement 'and' using that?
    -depends
    if you say false is 0, true is 1, you can
    only going to work if booleans are always 0 or 1

  //oh god what is happening//



  need to test to see whether or not binary value is 0 or not

  ex
    have r8 and r9
    want to put value in r10





short circuit

  p and q

  eval p
  if p is false, don't evaluate q
  
  p or q
  same for or
  if p is true, don't evaluate q

  our version is going to short circuit


  need to treat ands and ors differently than basic arithmetic operators

    
    
  void if_stmt_gen(if_stmt *s){
    symbol *out = label_new();
    symbol *true = label_new();
    bool_expr_gen(s->test, true, out);
    quads[next].opcode = O_NOOP;
    quads[next++].left = true;
    stmt_gen(s->body);
    quads[next].opcode = O_NOOP;
    quads[next++].left = out;

  }





Peephole optimization
  look at a small window of code and see if it can be replaced by better code


  ex.
    jmp J

    J:

  would want to remove the jmp




type checker
- traverse the parse tree
- needs to put an entry in the symbol table
- might need to create a new enumerated type
- whenever it sees a variable
  - if in arithmetic context, look up, see if integer
  - if in comparison context, look up, see if boolean
- compare the operands for every binary, unary, relationary operator


tempting to change grammar

  - curr.
    expr -> int_expr || bool_expr
    int_expr-> int_expr + int_expr
    ..
    .
    .
    ..
    + int_expr
    - int_expr


    bool_expr -> bool_expr AND bool_expr
                 bool_expr OR bool_expr
                 not bool_expr
                 .
                 .
                 ..

storing variables in registers

vairiable is alive if it gets used at some subsequent point

partition up the code into basic blocks

  sequence of statements where flow of control enters at the first statement and leaves at the end with no branches inbetween

algorithm for partitioning into basic blocks
  find leaders(first statement in basic blocks)
    the first line in a program is a leader
    any statement that is the target of a jump (whether
      conditional or unconditional) is a leader
    any statement immediately after a jump is a leader

dead code elimination


renaming temporary variables
  if you have  temp variable, change its name to something not used anywhere else, haven't changed the program

  a block is in 'normal form' if all assignments and temporaries are to new temporaries

interchange of statements

  can move around statements

flow graph
  nodes are basic blocks
  edge from b1 to b2
  if there is a jump from the last statement of b1 to b2
  or b2 follows b1 immediately in the program and b1 does not end in an unconditional jump

HW5

unary operators are in the scanner and parser already
  look at them and check anyways

opcode for increment and decrement needs to be implemented
  includes code generation
  can only be applied to variables
snlnot
  postfix
  lower precedence than the other logical operators
  change only parser and scanner



change binary in binary xxpr gen to unary, rmove operand because you only have one
set left operand to the remaining operant,
keep return statment

code generation

  unary minus:

  take left, put into r8
  negate r8
  move r8 back into result

$$= unary_expr_new(O_PP, expr_new(E_VARIABLE, variable_expr_new($2)))

boolexprgen different

pass them symbols that are labels that are going to be where to jump if it's true, or where to jump if it's false

recursively evaluate left operand,




look at the functions in place for binary generation and modify for unary

variable is alive in a basic block if the value it holds is used in the block



a:= 3;
b:= a+1;
a:=2;




liveness at the end of a block
  - be conservative
    - assume that all non-temporary variables are alive at the end of a block
  - use data-flow analysis to determine liveness at the end of the block


  need to store values in the symbol table
    - alive
    - next use

  start at the end
  go through all the variables that occur in the basic block
  scant hrought he block
  for each non-tempory, mark as alive and no next use
  for each temporary, mark as not alive and no next use
  scan backwards through the basic block
