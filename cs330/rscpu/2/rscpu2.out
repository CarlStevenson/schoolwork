This program accepts the title of a file from the user,
opens the file, then reads in lines of hexadecimal
bytes, and executes them in the simulated CPU.

Enter the name of the file containing the program: You chose: /home/mathcs/turnin/bracken/cs330/test1.1

Initial register values: 
Current Data: AC = 0, R = 0, ZCVN = 0000, AR = 0, PC = 0, DR = 0
	IR = 0, TR = 0

fetch1: AR = 0 and PC = 0
fetch2: DR = 0 and PC = 1
fetch3: IR = 0 and AR = 1
no op instruction
Current Data: AC = 0, R = 0, ZCVN = 0000, AR = 1, PC = 1, DR = 0
fetch1: AR = 1 and PC = 1
fetch2: DR = 255 and PC = 2
