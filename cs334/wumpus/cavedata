light.  A deep pit fills most of this room, however there is a narrow ledge by 
which north south east and west passages can be reached.  A rough-hewn rock
staircase leads down into the pit, disappearing into a passageway.

The Closet
   You are in a small closet.  Discarded rags on the floor suggest that it may
once have been used as a storage area for burial cloths.  The only exit is
through the door to the north.

Suspended Above The Chasm
   You are borne up by a mysterious force. Below your feet, the chasm continues
down into darkness.  Above you, the heights of the chasm also disappear into
blackness.  To the east is solid ground: a narrow ledge.

The Cavern of the Faithless
   You are standing at the bottom of a very deep chasm.  The rock walls which
which surround you on all sides vanish up into the darkness overhead.  You feel
quite daunted by the sheer weight of earth and stone which lies between you and
the surface above.

The Rough-Walled Chamber
   You are in a small spherical chamber, which has somehow been carved out of
the living stone.  Although you can see no exits, the room is lit and there is
an updraft...

The Hall of Challenging
   You are in a large, oval-shaped chamber.  Tapestries, depicting scenes of
single combat, hang from the roof of the chamber, which is high overhead.  A
vast array of weapons and armor, from various ages, adorn the walls all about
you.  The arena is ringed with torches, burning silently.

marble pillars line the eastern and western walls of the chamber.
