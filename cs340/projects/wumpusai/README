0. should we create a superclass of things with 3 states

   grenades, torches seem to have three states

   state one <-> state two <-> state three

   what can cause a transition between states?
   
      - player action (required command added to player)
         - generic 'use'?
         - multiple actions per object

      - timer action
         - automatic state change after time elapses

      - proximity to some other object

      - location in cavern

   => change Player.act to use list of methods
   => let this class 'register' methods into list
       (See Class.getDeclaredMethod)

1. let player pull pin on grenade; 
   change grenade constructor so not pulled when starting
   make the grenade kill things in the cave, fill pits?

2. fix torch;
   operationalize "lighting"
   move functionality to act function?
   longer lasting
   when out, name -> "burned out torch"

3. arrows?

4. check wumpus (but not shortestpath)
   create multiple wumpus in cave
   wumpus might move multiple times (no SKIPME implemented)
